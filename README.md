# VBA-Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains two VBA scripts for analyzing and summarizing stock data from multiple years. The scripts were created to address a task with somewhat contradictory instructions: the solution image showed no conditional formatting for Percentage Change, but the instructions listed conditional formatting for Percentage Change. As a result, two scripts were created to cater to both scenarios.

- **TicketCompile.bas**: This script does not contain Conditional Formatting for Percentage Change. It is designed to work with the "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm" Excel spreadsheet.

- **TicketCompile_2.bas**: This script includes Conditional Formatting for Percentage Change. It is designed to work with the "Multiple_year_stock_data_WITH_PERCENT_FORMATING.xlsm" Excel spreadsheet.

## Scripts and Data Files

- `TicketCompile.bas`
- `TicketCompile_2.bas`
- `Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm`
- `Multiple_year_stock_data_WITH_PERCENT_FORMATING.xlsm`

## Results

Three images are included in the repository, each representing the results for a different year: 2018, 2019, and 2020.

## Usage

You can use these scripts to analyze stock data in Excel. Depending on the requirements, choose the appropriate script based on whether Conditional Formatting for Percentage Change is needed or not.

1. Open the respective Excel spreadsheet (`Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm` or `Multiple_year_stock_data_WITH_PERCENT_FORMATING.xlsm`).

2. Enable macros if prompted.

3. Run the VBA script (`TicketCompile.bas` or `TicketCompile_2.bas`) within Excel to perform the analysis and generate summary tables.

4. The results will be displayed in the Excel spreadsheet.
